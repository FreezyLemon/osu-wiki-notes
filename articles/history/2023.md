The third season of [osu!monthly](/wiki/Community/osu!monthly) ended with the [9th edition](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-06-26-osumonthly-9), outlining the most important community events from March 2023. Mainly due to lacking interest and the effort required to author osu!monthly editions, the osu!monthly team decided to put the project on hold for the time being. Reorganising the work and publishing seasonal or annual editions instead was considered in various discussions.[^monthly-discord][^writing-proposal] [0x84f](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724), one of the third season's project leader, also published public polls to find out what the community was interested in and would like to see in the osu! website's news section in general.[^news-content-1][^news-content-2] Serving as a memorial to the first two seasons that were published as PDF, the 9th osu!monthly was realised [as a magazine](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://assets.ppy.sh/media/osu-monthly/2023-03/osu-monthly-2023-03.pdf) instead of the usual news posts, containing a cover artwork, mapping and skinning news and a crossword quiz. The quickest user to correctly fill out the crossword quiz would receive [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter). To accentuate the last edition as a special one, it was accompanied by interviews with EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE and [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418).
