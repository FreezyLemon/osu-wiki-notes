## January

- [lazer update (2023-01-21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6Y9B1pyIcw)
  - pp enabled for scores in lazer --> many people played on lazer
  - customisation for the Fade In Mod
  - new gameplay progress bar design (argon variant)
  - set preview time in editor

On the second week of January 2023, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) was interviewed by [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB), the team responsible for developing [Realm](https://realm.io/), a database system used in osu!(lazer). In the interview, they talked about topics such as the origin of osu!, how osu! is making revenue, osu!'s development and infrastructure as well as the transition to osu!(lazer).[^interview-mongodb]

Thanks to [ThePoon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/718454) and other contributors, [osu!stream](/wiki/osu!stream) was ported to [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), a game specifically designed for handheld devices and with unique gameplay elements. Until then, it was only available on [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS). An implementation on Android was not planned at the time when the development of the iOS version began in 2011 due to audio-related restrictions in Android's infrastructure that would heavily affect the gameplay experience.[^osu-stream-twitter][^osu-stream-pr]

The download page on the osu! website received a redesign, with an additional download option for osu!(lazer). Prior to this change, only osu!(stable) was downloadable via the website and users needed to download osu!(lazer) directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ppy/osu). At this time, the osu!(lazer) download was on the right side of the page. The eventual goal was to swap the two download dialogues, so the osu!(lazer) download would become more noticeable.[^lazer-download]

The third season of [osu!monthly](/wiki/Community/osu!monthly) ended with the [9th edition](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-06-26-osumonthly-9), outlining the most important community events from March 2023. Mainly due to the mapping team within the project disbanding[^mapping-team-disbanding] and the ample effort required to author osu!monthly editions, the osu!monthly team decided to put the project on hold for the time being. Reorganising the work and publishing seasonal or annual editions instead was considered in various discussions.[^monthly-discord][^writing-proposal] [0x84f](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724), one of the third season's project leader, also published public polls to find out what the community was interested in and would like to see in the osu! website's news section in general.[^news-content-1][^news-content-2] Serving as a memorial to the first two seasons that were published as PDF, the 9th osu!monthly was realised [as a magazine](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://assets.ppy.sh/media/osu-monthly/2023-03/osu-monthly-2023-03.pdf) instead of the usual news posts, containing a cover artwork, mapping and skinning news and a crossword quiz. The quickest user to correctly fill out the crossword quiz would receive [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter). To accentuate the last edition as a special one, it was accompanied by interviews with EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE and [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418).
