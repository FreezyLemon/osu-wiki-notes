  - due to lacking interest and the effort required to author osu!monthly editions, the osu!monthly team decided to put the project on hold for the time being. Reorganising the work and publishing seasonal or annual editions instead was considered in various (internal) discussions (and public polls).[^monthly-discord]<!--more sources in #osu-news/#osu-wiki?-->
  - include cover image: Cover of osu!monthly's last edition
  - other notes:
    - editions in video essay form were considered
